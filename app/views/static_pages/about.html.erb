      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Backyard Cryptoâ€™s goal is to establish a site that fills a critical gap in the cryptoworld. We noticed the community was making high risk investments, making uneducated decisions. Launching into trending tokens without care for its mission/utility. Our concern for the safety of the community, spurred our drive to build a trustworthy space to provide the fundamentals for everyone to make educated decisions. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Our mission and passion to help the community and care for the community, engineered a site that provides valuable information and gives back to the community. Thus, a new kind of Pedia was formed, one where monetary development would be shared with the individuals that make the site great.  We hope you enjoy Backyard Crypto! </p>
